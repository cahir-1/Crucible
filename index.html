        </summary>
        <p>
          The beginning of The Crucible follows a group of girls who go into the
          forest to dance. Innocent, supposed to be fun. Then, it follows with
          accusations of witchcraft, backstabbery, and later ostracization and
          imprisonment. But, prior to all of this, Salem had to be established.
          Salem was established as a religious community, fearing that the
          bordering land was the land of the devil. This relates to the American
          mind of communism where the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern Europe
          were all of communist parties, therefore evil. Once people come in and
          out of these places, though, people become suspicious if they had
          encountered the idea of evil they curated in their minds, suspecting
          even their closest friends or lovers.

        </summary>
        <p>
          This goes along with the last sentence stated in the previous section,
          but it is good to elaborate on. Basically, all of the chaos can be
          summed up to humans being scared. You are scared of the unknown, of
          the evil, and if someone were associated with that presence you'd be
          scared of them too. In the crucible, the hysteria is brought about by
          dancing in the forest, which sparks rumors of witchcraft. Abigail says
          on page 6, line 41, "Uncle, we did dance; let you tell them l
          confessed it— and I’ll be whipped if I must be. But they’re speakin’
          of witchcraft. Betty’s not witched." This is a direct objection by
          someone at the forefront of the event causing confusion, but the
          damage was already done. The people of the village wouldn't take that
          for an answer as Betty's illness is highly unusual, causing the girls
          involved with the dancing to lie their way out of persecution. This
          relates to McCarthy as those accused as a communist were forced to
          either out others to save themselves, or face a punishment they didn't
          necessarily deserve.

        <p>
          Both events escelated due to fear of ostracization, which was
          understandable as anyone outed as a witch or communist would lose
          their civil rights, along with the possibility of being executed. In
          the Crucible, the story progresses and hysteria grows as none of the
          original suspects are willing to state what really had happened, and
          instead opted to make lies in hopes of drawing attention away from
          themselves. During the Red Scare, Joseph McCarthy accused a lot of
          people himself. It wasn't as expansive as in the Crucible, but due to
          his proposal of freedom for convicted communists to out others, he
          essentially pulled the strings of mass hysteria, rather than a group
          causing it.

          Finally, the Crucible resolves with Proctor's confession and execution
          and an end to the mass hysteria. He dies regretful, but a good man.
          The Red Scare ended with McCarthy's followers losing faith in him, and
          with that he lost his power, dying soon after. Both are similar due to
          the fact that it shows how once embodiment of hysteria has lost its
          head it cannot continue any longer.

          <h1><b>The Takeaway</b></h1>
        </summary>
        <p>
          The main thing that we can take away from these incidents and stories
          is to always trust our own judgement. Both of these events, fiction or
          not, are brought about by people buying into a mob mentality. The
          Crucible is caused by young women lying and making false judgement
          claims. The Red Scares ruined the lives of many people all because of
          one man's suspicion. If we can use our own judgement to determine and
          deem what we think is worthy information or not we can lead as
          stronger people, not bound by a single persons idea. We're responsible
          for what we believe is true, and that also means we stand up to what
          we believe isn't true. This is honestly just a pretentious way of
          dragging out the idea of 'think for yourself,' but I do believe the
          importance of that idea still stands today. We have so man outlets of
          media, so many credible and uncredible sources, that it is a necessity
          to be able to identify and determine what false information is. The
          Salem Witch Trials began around four hundred years ago, and the red
          scare only happened about half a century ago. It doesn't matter what
          time period we live in, what matters is what we make of our situation,
          and how strong our conviction to our morals is. I still have a few
          words to go, so just in general: think for yourself. Own up to
          mistakes, don't let guilt or any other emotion consume you, as John
          Proctor properly represents.
